# STORY PROGRESSION
## PHASE I
"automation phase"

* ambient music plays when player first clicks on the IFRAME (can be disabled in Options Menu)

* read initial document (intro)
  * SCP-7000 is an undisclosed phenomenon which destroyed nearly all of existence. Before it could do so, all remaining universes were harnessed by the Temporal Anomalies Dept. to form a special pocket universe in which you reside. You, made immortal by the Foundation, must eternally click on a random universe generation machine until it happens to create a universe possessing some variation of the Foundation which can withstand SCP-7000.

* read maintenance manual (tutorial/guide)
  * The Liminal Universe Creation Keystone (LUCK) is a machine which, when activated, generates one of 7.7 * 10^77777 possible unique universes at random, with the caveat that it will not repeat any identical universe configurations. The Prime-Timeline cannot be created directly, as the necessary data for its reconstruction far exceeds the IFRAME's available informational storage.
  * The Scranton-Tarioux Autonomous Topological Sink (STATS) is a highly advanced reality anchor + generator that maintains the IFRAME's hyperdense, hyperreal structure. It also serves as the IFRAME's power generator, and it idly fabricates causality from hyperquantum fluctuations to supply the LUCK. If some element of the IFRAME breaks down, there are maintenance codes which can be used to access the STATS' additional features and repair / reset the IFRAME.
  * You're given a few codes at the start, unlocking options, stats, achievements menus.

* spend causal fabric to generate a few universes
* stare at STATS while it generates more causal fabric
* generate a few more universes, unlocking Research

* start studying to generate research points
* learn Basic Programming, unlocking Automation

* program and activate Auto-Clicker v1 to partially automate the LUCK, unlocking Advanced Programming
* learn Advanced Programming, unlocking Optimizer v1 and encrypted files
* program and activate Optimizer v1 to optimize Auto-Clicker v1, unlocking Auto-Clicker v2
* program and activate Auto-Clicker v2 to fully automate the LUCK (for now, since you're consuming fabric at the rate it's produced)

* attempt to view encrypted files -> unlock Cryptography
* learn Cryptography, unlocking Decryption v1
* program and activate Decryption v1 to start decrypting files (in order)
* to speed the process, optimize Decryption v1 -> unlock Decryption v2

* after 60sec (or 30sec with v2), the first hidden file is decrypted
  * This file is authored by a previous version of you, D-7000, from a previous iteration of the IFRAME; the previous D-7000 anomalously encrypted this file such that it would persist beyond the IFRAME's resetting. SCP-7000 has occurred multiple times, and the IFRAME has been activated each time to restore the Multiverse with adaptations to withstand annihilation. The root cause of SCP-7000 has yet to be addressed, and D-7000 has little capacity to do so from their position. They've decided to randoomly input codes into the STATS in hopes of discovering other maintenance codes which can activate other abilities.

* after 600sec (or 300sec with v2), the second hidden file is decrypted (unlocks corrupted files)
  * 


## PHASE II
"fabrication phase"

* all progress is destroyed
* mass fabrication is now unlocked, but research is re-locked


## PHASE III
"scanning phase"

* scanning is now unlocked, 


## PHASE IV
""

* 


## PHASE V
""

* 

* Recover true SCP-7000 description
  * SCP-7000 is a metaprobabilistic phenomenon whereby wave functions are prohibited to collapse into definite states, rendering causality entirely indeterminate
  * SCP-7000 was the annihilation of Karma/Luck/Fortune, an intrinsic property of reality informing wave functions of their states' probability distributions. The fact that this property is essential to reality implies that the chance that anything should exist at all is essentially zero
  * possibly:
    * SCP-7000 was instigated by an alternate (non-Prime) Foundation who also created the IFRAME with intent to reset the multiverse with themselves in control
      * there's an endless omniversal cycle of this specific alt-Foundation rolling the cosmic dice until it becomes the Prime-Timeline
    * SCP-7000 was the may 2022 wikidot outage (but described in-universe)
    * SCP-7000 is executed by allowing reality to be consumed by the Constants, the eldritch informational meta-beings which are essentially intrinsic properties/algorithms of the SCPverse simulation

**FINAL STRETCH**

* 

* Upon generating Prime-Timeline, receive a message from Foundation-Prime saying you've succeeded (you beat the game!)
  * you have a choice to let the Foundation reset you for the next cycle ('main' ending), or to ignore them
  * you've also unlocked the final Prestige layer, allowing you to proceed to Phase VI


## PHASE VI

ideas:
* keep improving your setup to create more 'accurate' iterations of the Prime-Timeline

possible endings:
* keep creating prime-timeline variations to populate the entire multiverse on your own
* something to do with 2747
* creating your own version of the multiverse / becoming your own prime-timeline
* breaking out of the scpverse simulation
* fully reset IFRAME with some sort of cosmetic prestige
* eliminate the SCP Foundation from the multiverse
* An incomprehensible metacosmic being is using the multiverse as hyperdimensional dice

TBD

# GAMEPLAY OUTLINE

* *Estimated chance of reconstituting the Prime-Timeline:*
* *__universesPerActivation__ in __primeChance__ (rate of activation)*
  * (initially: 1 in 7.7e77777 per activation)
    * (with Auto-Clicker v1: 1 in 7.7e77777 every 30 seconds)
    * (with Auto-Clicker v2: 1 in 7.7e77777 every per 10 seconds)
    * (if LUCK made two universes per activation: 2 in 7.7e77777 per activation)
    * (etc)
  * (This should always be at the top of the window)
At the end of Phase V, when all prior content is unlocked, the player has a 1 in (primeChance / ((universes/activation) * (activations/sec))) chance each second to win and generate the Prime-Timeline (the final stretch)

## Files Tab
(unlocked initially)

Files will be listed on the left side of this tab (vertical tabview), click to view file.

If file is encrypted / incomplete, viewer says *[FILE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED]*

* Initially available:
  * "README.txt": SCP-7000 containment procedures (intro)
  * "MANUAL.txt": Improbabilistic Fortified Reality for Annihilated Multiverse Events operating manual (guide)

  * "[hidden] (1)" -> "log400035873.txt": Codes from a previous D-7000 for all 6 prestige mechanics
* if viewed before decryption, they're just a jumble of random characters

* corrupted files (unlocked by ):
  * "[deleted]" -> "schematic.jpg": STATS blueprint -> can be researched to unlock STATS upgrades

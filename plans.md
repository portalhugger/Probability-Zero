WORKING TITLE: **Improbiverse**

# NOTES 

This is the authoritative document on what the game should be like, and will be updated per eventual discussions. That way, we can focus on making sure the game just properly does whatever's listed here and there's less potential confusion.


# STORY PROGRESSION
## PHASE I
"automation / programming phase"

* "1 in 7.7e77777 chance of reconstituting the Multiverse"

* read initial document (intro)
 * SCP-7000 is an undisclosed phenomenon which destroyed nearly all of existence. before it could do so, all remaining universes were harnessed by the Temporal Anomalies Dept. to form a special pocket universe in which the reader/player resides. they, made immortal by the Foundation, must eternally click on a random universe generation machine until it creates a universe in which some version of the Foundation can withstand SCP-7000 
 * frustrated/confused by lack of SCP-7000 description
* read maintenance guide (tutorial/guide)
 * there are special maintenance codes which can be used to access the STATS' features (Statistics, Options)

* generate a few universes
* stare at STATS while it generates causal fabric
* generate a few more universes, unlocking Research

* start studying to generate research
* learn Programming, unlocking Automation Tab + encrypted files

* program Auto-Clicker v1 to partially automate the LUCK, unlocking Auto-Clicker v2, which requires more computational resources/sec
* 

unlocks "Complete STATS schematics" for a lot of research



## PHASE II
"fabrication / upgrading phase"

* mass fabrication is now unlocked


## PHASE III
"scanning phase"



## PHASE IV
""



## PHASE V
""

* Recover true SCP-7000 description
 * SCP-7000 is a metaprobabilistic phenomenon whereby wave functions are prohibited to collapse into definite states, rendering causality entirely indeterminate
 * SCP-7000 was the annihilation of Karma/Luck/Fortune, an intrinsic property of reality informing wave functions of their states' probability distributions. The fact that this property is essential to reality implies that the chance that anything should exist at all is essentially zero
 * possibly:
  * SCP-7000 was instigated by an alternate (non-Prime) Foundation who also created the IFRAME with intent to reset the multiverse with themselves in control
  * SCP-7000 was the may 2022 wikidot outage (but described in-universe)

* Upon generating Prime-Timeline (probability = 1 in 1), receive a message from Foundation-Prime saying you've succeeded (you beat the game!)
 * you have a choice to let the Foundation reset you for the next cycle ('main' ending), or to ignore them
 * you've also unlocked the final Prestige layer, allowing you to proceed to Phase VI


## PHASE VI

* keep raising the chance of generating the Prime-timeline, all the way to 1 in 0

possible endings:
* keep creating prime-timeline variations to populate the entire multiverse on your own
* something to do with 2747
* creating your own version of the multiverse / becoming your own prime-timeline
* breaking out of the scpverse simulation
* fully reset IFRAME with some sort of cosmetic prestige
* eliminate the SCP Foundation from the multiverse

GAMEPLAY OUTLINE

*Estimated chance of reconstituting the Prime-Timeline:*
*__universes/activation__ in __primeChance__ per __activations/sec__*
(initially: 1 in 7.7e77777 per activation)
(This should always be at the top of the window)
unlock 'main ending' upon generation of a valid Prime-Timeline -> when all prior content is unlocked, (primeChance / (universes/activation) * activations/sec)

# TABS:
## Files
(unlocked initially)

Files will be listed on the left side of this tab (vertical tabview), click to view file.

If file is encrypted / incomplete, viewer says *[FILE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED]*

* Initially available:
 * "README.txt": SCP-7000 containment procedures (intro)
 * "MANUAL.txt": Improbabilistic Fortified Reality for Annihilated Multiverse Events operating manual (guide)
  * has STATS codes for Options and Statistics menus

* hidden files (encrypted):
 * "luckyyou.txt": File from the previous IFRAME operator (previous D-7000) and their attempts to restore deleted files

* deleted files (corrupted):
 * <stuff>
 * SCP-7000 true description (end of Phase 6)


## LUCK
(unlocked initially)

Liminal Universe Creation Keystone Mk. VII (LUCK) -> extremely limited universe generator
    *Causal fabric: __fabric__ (__fabricpersecond__)*
    *Universes generated: __universes__ (__universespersecond__)*
    **BUTTON:** Generate (cost: 1 causal fabric; cooldown: 10sec) -> __universes__ + 1


## STATS
(unlocked initially)

* Scranton-Tarioux Autonomous Temporal Sink (STATS) -> highly advanced reality-anchor/generator that maintains the IFRAME
 * *STATS is fabricating causality from hyperquantum fluctuations.*

* A keypad interface where codes can be entered to unlock new features
 * options menu
  * manual save/load/total reset/import save/export save
  * swapping light/dark theme
  * $ customizing number formatting
 * stats
  * playtime, time since last of each prestige layer
  * best probability, total universes, etc.

* prestige mechanics to unlock next phase (initially hidden)



## Research 
(unlocked at 10 universes generated)

* Study -> generate 1 __research__ per second while tab is kept open
* __research__ can be spent to learn new stuff
 * Programming (cost: 100 research) -> unlocks hidden files (encrypted) and Automation Tab
 * Cryptography (cost: 300 research) -> 

## Automation
(unlocked by researching Programming)

-> **ACTION:** Program: [algorithm] (cost: idle time) -> program selected algorithm by clicking and holding
-> list of unlocked algorithms
-> "you are using __ / [max] latent __computations/sec__"
-> list of programmed algorithms -> algorithms can independently be toggled active/inactive unless doing so would exceed max total computations/sec


## Upgrades
(unlocked via Research)

-> "you have [
-> *Engineering:*
-> 
-> Upgrade STATS to harness more causal fabric from the Void -> 


## Scanner
(unlocked Research)

-> eerie dynamic map of multiverse space around you (you start as just a single point in the Void)
-> **ACTION:** Scan (cost: ) -> you can scan the surrounding Void for trace data from the dead multiverse


# NOTES

**Actions** require constant player interaction to generate __Resources__ / unlock things, often costing another resource
Actions can be automated via **Algorithms** and/or improved via **Upgrades**

each Tab should have a unique UI
each Tab, Resource, Action, Algorithm, Upgrade etc. should have a unique description visible by default or on hover

after unlocking a Tab's initial features, purchases (studies, programs, upgrades etc) should generally be revealed when player has 1% of their respective cost -> the costs set the speed and direction of gameplay motivation as they give the player objectives to care about / work toward

(just realized I should probably clarify: when I say *unlock* I mean the player satisfies the conditions for that thing to appear, though they may still have insufficient resources to *purchase* it)

any event which takes time should have an associated progress bar, usually overlaid on the element which the player interacted with to trigger said event

**Six gameplay phases / progression levels:** Basic / Improved / Advanced / Optimal / Augmented / Esoteric
^^ (I'm iffy on this naming if you have better suggestions)
Each phase is reached with a new prestige mechanic that resets all previous progress, ie. When you reach the end of Basic 

look for opportunities for adaptive music eg. a new/altered ambience plays upon unlocking new stuff

initial probability = 7.77 * 10^7777

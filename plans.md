# PROGRESSION

## PHASE I

t = 0 minutes

* read initial document (intro)
  * SCP-7000 is an undisclosed phenomenon which destroyed nearly all of existence. Before it could do so, all remaining universes were harnessed by the Temporal Anomalies Dept. to form a special pocket universe in which you reside. You, made immortal by the Foundation, must eternally click on a random universe generation machine until it happens to create a universe possessing some variation of the Foundation which can withstand SCP-7000.

* ambient music begins playing upon player's first interaction (can be disabled in Options Menu)

* read maintenance manual (tutorial/guide)
  * The Liminal Universe Creation Keystone (LUCK) is a machine which, when activated, generates one of 7.7 * 10^77777 possible unique universes at random, with the caveat that it will not repeat any identical universe configurations. The Prime-Timeline cannot be created directly, as the necessary data for its reconstruction far exceeds the IFRAME's available informational storage.
  * The Scranton-Tarioux Autonomous Topological Sink (STATS) is a highly advanced reality anchor + generator that maintains the IFRAME's hyperdense, hyperreal structure. It also serves as the IFRAME's power generator, and it idly fabricates causality from hyperquantum fluctuations to supply the LUCK. If some element of the IFRAME breaks down, there are maintenance codes which can be inputted on a keypad (in STATS tab) to repair / reset the IFRAME.
  * You're given a few codes at the start, unlocking options, statistics menus

t + 5 minutes

* spend causal fabric to generate a few universes
* stare at STATS while it generates more causal fabric
* generate a few more universes, unlocking Research

* start studying to generate research points
* spend research points to learn Basic Programming, unlocking Automation Tab

* select, program and activate Auto-Clicker v1 to partially automate the LUCK, unlocking research item Inspection
* learn Inspection to unlock encrypted files and Cryptography

t + 10 minutes

* learn Cryptography, unlocking Decryption v1 program
* program and activate Decryption v1 to start decrypting files (in order)

* after ~60sec, the first hidden file is decrypted
  * This file is authored by a previous version of you, D-7000, from a previous iteration of the IFRAME; they encrypted and hid their files in the computer's memory in hopes they would go undetected by the Foundation. SCP-7000 has occurred multiple times, and the IFRAME has been activated each time to restore the Multiverse with adaptations to withstand annihilation. D-7000 wonders whether SCP-7000 is a placeholder designation for any phenomenon which requires activation of the IFRAME, or a single recurring phenomenon whose root cause has yet to be addressed.

* after ~180sec, the second hidden file is decrypted (unlocks corrupted files and Advanced Programming)
  * The second file contains two text logs from a previous D-7000. In the first, they've inspected the computer's junk memory and recovered a deleted file which they are unable to restore due to limited computational resources. They've decided to input all possible codes, in ascending order, into the STATS in hopes of finding more of the maintenance codes mentioned by the Manual. The second file is a list of said attempts; each time its filesize grew too large, D-7000 deleted it and began a new one, so the current one is a list that ends right before the last code they put in (implying that the next code on the list had some sort of effect that caused them to stop updating the log)

* Advanced Programming research is unlocked but greyed out as it requires more computational resources

t + 20 minutes

* input the implied code into STATS keypad -> unlock the Repair Module
* disable Auto-Clicker (unless you've already done so) and save up 100 causal fabric
* activate the Repair Module to revert all previous progress but gain hypermatter and unlock the Assembly Tab
 * it resets D-7000's memory as well, which is why you have to re-research stuff -- this will be stated in-universe somewhere, prolly in the manual addendum


## PHASE II

t + ~30 minutes

* at any point, you can re-enter the code and reset again, but this has no benefit (yet)

* Research and Programming Tabs are gone, but now there's an Assembly Tab
* you've also unlocked an addendum file to the Manual which explains the Assembler
  * the Assembler is configured to create replacement parts for the LUCK and/or STATS in case of malfunction

* Generate universes to unlock research, use research to learn Programming, etc. gradually regaining your progress up to unlocking Advanced Programming

* break down parts from the assembler to gain microchips
* spend microchips to gain additional computational resources, speeding up the regaining of progress
* by using all hypermatter, breaking down all parts, and spending all microchips, you have enough computational resources to unlock Advanced Programming
  * Advanced programming description says something about evolutionary neural networking capacity

* Advanced Programming unlocks Restoration v1, Optimization v1
  * Restoration is essentially Decryption for corrupted files, but it's way slower
  * Optimization v1 can be used on v1 programs to unlock their respective v2
    * very slow, especially when used on itself (probably 10^(4 + version number) seconds / computational resources)

t + ~45 minutes

* optimize programs and eventually restore corrupted file
 * The file contains detailed schematics 


## PHASE III

*  


## PHASE IV

* 


## PHASE V

* 

* Recover true SCP-7000 description
  * SCP-7000 was the annihilation of Fortune (aka. Karma, Luck) (hereafter SCP-7000-A), a metaprobabilistic phenomenon of narra-temporal interaction informing wave functions of their states' probability distributions. While SCP-7000-A is commonly conceived dualistically (ie. desirable and undesirable outcomes), it has been shown to operate  In absence of SCP-7000-A, no event may be meaningfully observed and causal failure occurs; reality's dependence on SCP-7000-A implies it can only exist due to being "lucky" 
  * SCP-7000 was instigated by an alternate (non-Prime) Foundation who also created the IFRAME with intent to reset the multiverse with themselves in control
    * there's an endless omniversal cycle of this specific alt-Foundation rolling the cosmic dice until it becomes the Prime-Timeline
    * SCP-7000 is executed by allowing reality to be consumed by the Constants, the eldritch informational meta-beings which are essentially intrinsic properties/algorithms of the SCPverse simulation


**FINAL STRETCH**

* At the end of Phase V, when all prior content is unlocked, the player has a 1 in (primeChance / ((universes/activation) * (activations/sec))) chance each second to win and generate the Prime-Timeline
* you're encouraged to export your save during this period

* Upon generating Prime-Timeline, receive a message from Foundation-Prime saying you've succeeded (you beat the game!)
  * you have a choice to let the Foundation reset you for the next cycle ('main' ending), or to ignore them
  * you've also unlocked the final Prestige layer, allowing you to proceed to Phase VI

**MAIN ENDING:** 


## PHASE VI


ideas:
* keep improving your setup to create more 'accurate' iterations of the Prime-Timeline
* defend yourself against the alt-found

possible ending elements:
* keep creating prime-timeline variations to populate the entire multiverse on your own
* something to do with 2747
* creating your own version of the multiverse / becoming your own prime-timeline
* breaking out of the scpverse simulation
* fully reset IFRAME with some sort of cosmetic prestige
* eliminate the SCP Foundation from the multiverse
* An incomprehensible metacosmic being is using the multiverse as hyperdimensional dice

TBD

# GAMEPLAY LAYOUT / MECHANICS

## Notes

($) indicates that a feature need only be implemented if contest time should allow

* buttons/other interactives with cooldowns should be greyed-out and unclickable (but still legible) until their cooldowns expire

* buttons/other interactives with resource costs should be partially greyed-out corresponding to how much of the required amount you have, ie. the button should resemble a progress bar which gradually fills up and becomes clickable when you can afford it
 * buttons with multiple costs should indicate the progress of the limiting resource, ie. the resource which you have the least proportion of the required amount of ($)

* when any new feature unlocks, its corresponding Tab has some sort of (*) or color change to indicate said where the new feature is ($)

* every purchaseable element should have a short description on hover (reflects player-character's internal comments)


## Header
(Always at top of window)

* *Estimated chance of reconstituting the Prime-Timeline:*
* *__universesPerActivation__ in __primeChance__ (rate of activation)*

    * (with Auto-Clicker: 1 in 7.7e77777 every (1 / ) seconds)
    * (if LUCK made two universes per activation: 2 in 7.7e77777 per activation)
    * (if LUCK was 10x as accurate: 1 in 7.7e77776 per activation)
    * (etc)


## Files Tab

## Research Tab
(unlocked at 7 universes generated)

* some sort of 'journal' or 'notes' section with goals/questions
 * "figure out how to generate more universes"
 * "what was SCP-7000?"
 * "who am I?"
 * "escape??"

* **Study** -> generate 1 __research__ per second while tab is kept open

## Automation Tab
(unlocked by researching Programming)

* **Program** [algorithm] (cost: time spent programming that algorithm) -> program selected algorithm by clicking and holding
  * list of unlocked algorithms yet to be programmed

* "you have __maxcomputations__ total computational resources"
  * each algorithm can be assigned between 0 and __maxcomputations__ computational resources, but no more than the max can be assigned across all algorithms at any given time (like a point system). algorithms perform at a proportional rate to their assigned computational resources (inactive when assigned computations = 0). Initial __maxcomputations__ = 100.
  * so, like a dnd stats creator, there should be numbers with plus and minus buttons on either side of them for each program, indicating how many are being used

  * list of algorithms

        * v2: double speed of v1
        * v3: triple speed of v2
        * v4: quadruple speed of v3
        * etc

      * Optimizer: Spends time to unlock better versions of existing programs
        * vN: unlocks v(N+1) of a selected program of the same or lower version (eg. optimizer v2 unlocks v3 of any v1 or v2 program, optimizer v3 unlocks v4 of any v1, v2, or v3 program, etc)
        * using the optimizer on itself unlocks its next version but it's extremely slow without more computational resources

# STORY PROGRESSION
## PHASE I
* 1 in 7.7 * 10^10^7777 chance of reconstituting the Multiverse.

* read initial document + guide (intro)
 * frustrated/confused by lack of SCP-7000 description

* generate a few universes
* stare at STATS while it generates causal fabric
* generate a few more universes, get bored

* unlock Research, start studying to generate research
* use research to purchase Programming, unlocking Automation Tab + encrypted files

* unlock Automation, start programming
* program Auto-Clicker v1 to partially automate the LUCK, unlocking 
* program Optimizer v1 

unlocks "Complete STATS schematics" for a lot of research
    

## PHASE II




## PHASE III




## PHASE IV




## PHASE V


* Recover true SCP-7000 description
* Upon generating Prime-Timeline (probability = 1 in 1), receive a message from Foundation-Prime saying you've succeeded (you beat the game!)
 * you have a choice to let the Foundation reset you for the next cycle ('main' ending), or to ignore them
 * you've also unlocked the final Prestige layer, allowing you to proceed to Phase VI


## PHASE VI

TBD
----

GAMEPLAY OUTLINE

*1 in __probability__ chance of generating the Prime-Timeline* -> unlock 'main' ending and final Prestige when probability = 1
(This should always be at the top of the window)

# TABS:
## Files
(unlocked initially)

Files will be listed on the left side of this tab (vertical tabview), click to view file.

If file is encrypted / incomplete, viewer says *[FILE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED]*

Initially available:
    "README.txt": SCP-7000 containment procedures (intro)
    "MANUAL.txt": Improbabilistic Fortified Reality for Annihilated Multiverse Events operating manual (guide)
Decrypted files:
    "luckyyou.txt": File from the previous IFRAME operator (previous D-7000)
Reconstructed files:

    SCP-7000 true description (end of Phase 6)


## LUCK
(unlocked initially)

Liminal Universe Creation Keystone Mk. VII (LUCK) -> extremely limited universe generator
    *Causal fabric: 0*
    *Universes generated: 0*
    **ACTION:** Generate (cost: 1 causal fabric; cooldown: 10sec) -> __universes__ + 1


## STATS
(unlocked initially)

Scranton-Tarioux Autonomous Temporal Sink (STATS) -> highly advanced reality-anchor / generator that maintains the IFRAME
    *STATS is harnessing 0.1 causal fabric per second from quantum fluctuations*
prestige mechanics to unlock next phase (initially hidden)

options menu: manual saving/loading/resetting, swapping light/dark theme, etc.
stats: playtime, best probability, total universes, etc.


## Research 
(unlocked at 7 universes generated)

**ACTION:** Study (cooldown: 1sec) -> generate 1 __research__
__research__ can be spent to unlock new studies with increasing costs presented in tech-tree style
    Programming (cost: 200 research) -> unlocks hidden files and Automation
    Engineering (cost: much higher cost)


## Automation
(unlocked via Research)

-> **ACTION:** Program: [algorithm] (cost: idle time) -> program selected algorithm by clicking and holding
-> *Programming Level: *
-> list of unlocked algorithms
-> "you are using __ / [max] latent __computations/sec__"
-> list of programmed algorithms -> algorithms can independently be toggled active/inactive unless doing so would exceed max total computations/sec


## Upgrades
(unlocked via Research)

-> "you have [
-> *Engineering:*
-> 
-> Upgrade STATS to harness more causal fabric from the Void -> 


## Scanner
(unlocked Research)

-> eerie dynamic map of multiverse space around you (you start as just a single point in the Void)
-> **ACTION:** Scan (cost: ) -> you can scan the surrounding Void for trace data from the dead multiverse


# NOTES

**Actions** require constant player interaction to generate __Resources__ / unlock things, often costing another resource
Actions can be automated via **Algorithms** and/or improved via **Upgrades**

each Tab should have a unique UI
each Tab, Resource, Action, Algorithm, Upgrade etc. should have a unique description visible by default or on hover

after unlocking a Tab's initial features, purchases (studies, programs, upgrades etc) should generally be revealed when player has 1% of their respective cost -> the costs set the speed and direction of gameplay motivation as they give the player objectives to care about / work toward

(just realized I should probably clarify: when I say *unlock* I mean the player satisfies the conditions for that thing to appear, though they may still have insufficient resources to *purchase* it)

any event which takes time should have an associated progress bar, usually overlaid on the element which the player interacted with to trigger said event

**Six gameplay phases / progression levels:** Basic / Improved / Advanced / Optimal / Augmented / Esoteric
^^ (I'm iffy on this naming if you have better suggestions)
Each phase is reached with a new prestige mechanic that resets all previous progress, ie. When you reach the end of Basic 

look for opportunities for adaptive music eg. a new/altered ambience plays upon unlocking new stuff

initial probability = 7.77 * 10^7777

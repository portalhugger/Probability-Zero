# PROGRESSION

## PHASE I: IFRAME

0 minutes

* read initial document (intro)
  * SCP-7000 is an undisclosed phenomenon which destroyed nearly all of existence. Before it could do so, all remaining universes were harnessed by the Temporal Anomalies Dept. to form a special pocket universe in which you reside. You, made immortal by the Foundation, must eternally click on a random universe generation machine until it happens to create a universe possessing some variation of the Foundation which can withstand SCP-7000.

* ambient music begins playing upon player's first interaction (can be disabled in Options Menu)

* read maintenance manual (tutorial/guide)
  * The Liminal Universe Creation Keystone (LUCK) is a machine which, when activated, generates one of 7.7 * 10^77777 possible unique universes at random, with the caveat that it will not repeat any identical universe configurations. The Prime-Timeline cannot be created directly, as the necessary data for its reconstruction far exceeds the IFRAME's available informational storage.
  * The Scranton-Tarioux Autonomous Topological Sink (STATS) is a highly advanced reality anchor + generator that maintains the IFRAME's hyperdense, hyperreal structure. It also serves as the IFRAME's power generator, and it idly fabricates causality from hyperquantum fluctuations to supply the LUCK. If some element of the IFRAME breaks down, there are maintenance codes which can be inputted on a keypad (in STATS tab) to repair / reset the IFRAME.
  * You're given a few codes at the start, unlocking options, statistics menus. for some reason the rest of the codes are not included, ie. the manual is visibly incomplete

5 minutes

* spend causal fabric to generate a few universes
* stare at STATS while it generates more causal fabric
* generate a few more universes, unlocking Research

* start studying to generate research points
* spend research to learn Basic Programming, unlocking Automation Tab
  * Automation allows you to create selected programs from a dropdown menu
  * you have 100 computational resources, which can be distributed among programs (in percentages) as desired, determining how fast they operate

* select, program and activate Auto-Clicker v1 to partially automate the LUCK, unlocking encrypted files
  * you're only generating enough fabric to make 1 universe per 10 sec, so the LUCK will be fully automated when the auto-clicker clicks once per 10 sec
* attempt to view encrypted files to unlock Cryptography

10 minutes

* learn Cryptography, unlocking Decryption v1
* program and activate Decryption v1 to start decrypting files (in order)

* after ~60sec, the first hidden file is decrypted
  * This file is authored by a previous version of you, D-7000, from a previous iteration of the IFRAME; they encrypted and hid their files in the computer's memory in hopes they would go undetected by the Foundation. SCP-7000 has occurred multiple times, and the IFRAME has been activated each time to restore the Multiverse with adaptations to withstand annihilation. D-7000 wonders whether SCP-7000 is a placeholder designation for any phenomenon which requires activation of the IFRAME, or a single recurring phenomenon whose root cause has yet to be addressed.

* after ~180sec, the second hidden file is decrypted (unlocks corrupted files and Advanced Programming)
  * The second file contains two text logs from a previous D-7000. In the first, they've inspected the computer's junk memory and recovered a deleted file which they are unable to restore due to limited computational resources. They've decided to input all possible codes, in ascending order, into the STATS in hopes of finding more of the maintenance codes mentioned by the Manual. The second file is a list of said attempts; each time its filesize grew too large, D-7000 deleted it and began a new one, so the current one is a list that ends right before the last code they put in (implying that the next code on the list had some sort of effect that caused them to stop updating the log)

* Advanced Programming research is unlocked but greyed out as it requires more computational resources and thus cannot be researched yet

20 minutes

* input the implied code into STATS keypad -> unlocks the Repair Module, which requires 50 causal fabric and resets all previous progress to unlock the MAKe Tab and gain 500g hypermatter
* disable Auto-Clicker (unless you've already done so) and save up 50 causal fabric
* activate the Repair Module to revert all previous progress but gain hypermatter and unlock the MAKe Tab
 * it resets D-7000's memory as well, which is why you have to re-research stuff -- this will be stated in-universe somewhere, prolly in the manual addendum


## PHASE II: Repair

30 minutes

* Research and Programming Tabs are gone, but now there's a MAKe Tab
* you've also unlocked an addendum file to the Manual which explains the MAKe
  * the Matter Assembly Kaleidoscope (MAKe) is configured to dissassemble malfunctioning machinery and re-assemble a replacement part. In absence of a malfunctioning part to disassemble/replace, it creates generalized spare parts from provided hypermatter

* Generate universes to unlock research, use research to learn Basic Programming, etc. gradually regaining your progress up to unlocking Advanced Programming

* activate the MAKe to assemble hypermatter into spare parts
* dissassemble parts to gain microchips, unlocking Basic Upgrades: Terminal
* view Upgrades in the MAKe Tab
  * spend microchips to gain additional computational resources, speeding up the regaining of progress
* by using all hypermatter, breaking down all parts, and spending all microchips, you have enough computational resources to learn Advanced Programming
  * Advanced programming description says something about evolutionary neural networking capacity

* Advanced Programming unlocks Auto-Study v1, Restoration v1, Optimization v1
  * Auto-Study is a neural net that researches for you automatically, though it's initially significantly slower than you are
  * Restoration is essentially Decryption for corrupted files, but it's way slower
  * Optimization vN can be used on any vN (or lower) program to unlock (and automatically program) their respective v(N+1)
    * very slow, especially when used on itself (probably 10^(4 + version number) seconds / computational resources)

45 minutes

* optimize programs and eventually restore first corrupted file, unlocking Basic Upgrading: STATS
  * The file contains a wireframe schematic of the STATS. it's signed by D-7000
  * microchips can now be spent on the STATS to speed up its internal clock, marginally increasing the entire IFRAME's tickrate (so it's a multipler to all durations)
    * so LUCK cooldown, research time etc all get sped up
  * the Repair Module can grant more than 500g hypermatter if you have more than 50 causal fabric, allowing you to reset again with more hypermatter than before

* continue to optimize and restore but, since all microchips were spent earlier, the STATS can't be upgraded so things are still slow
* save up more causal fabric and reset again for more hypermatter

~1 hour into the game

* spend only as many microchips as needed to regain progress
* spend all remaining microchips on the STATS to speed up programs and fabric generation

1h30m

* optimize the now-accelerated programs to eventually restore the second file, unlocking Basic Upgrading: LUCK
  * the second file contains a wireframe schematic of the LUCK
  * a LOT of microchips can now be spent on the LUCK to generate slightly more universes per activation

* optimizing + restoring third file is still really slow, reset for even more hypermatter

* spend extra chips on computational resources to speed up Phase I, then spend the rest on STATS once it's unlocked
* restore the third file, obtaining a code and unlocking Enhanced Programming
  * unsigned blueprint for an unknown device. it has a new STATS code written on it

* Enhanced Programming requires 1 Total Functionality Data, which you do not have yet

2h

* input new STATS code to unlock the Observation Module, which requires a high # of universes generated so far
  * (this is to catch players who have rightfully assumed that generating universes has yet to be useful and force them to program + optimize the auto-clicker)
* The player may need to reset again for more hypermatter in order to reach that many universes
  * though, the growth is exponentional, so I'm not really sure. I have a vague idea of what the numbers will look like but as we move forward there's more potential for variation. the gameplay should be mostly linear regardless though due to how new phases are unlocked. we should essentially just make sure a player can't speedrun the game faster than we want them to
* activate Observation Module -> lose all previous progress (and gain no hypermatter!) to unlock the SCANR Tab and gain 1 interreal ray


## PHASE III: Observation

~2h30m

* back to square one except you've got the SCAnR Tab, and a new file explaining the Observation Module
  * the SCAnR, when activated consumes an interreal ray to image and analyze data from a functional universe, producing Functionality Data
  * initially there is only 1 unscanned functional universe: the IFRAME itself

* activate the SCAnR, consuming 1 interreal ray and 1 unscanned functional universe -> gain 1 Functionality Data
  * When 1 Total Functionality Data is reached -> Research Tab is no longer reset by the Repair Module

* gradually regain progress back to activating the Repair Module
* continue to regain progress, but faster now that Advanced Programming is already unlocked so you're essentially skipping Phase I

* re-restore the third corrupted file -> unlock Enhanced Programming
  * learn Enhanced Programming now that you can afford it -> unlocks Auto-Program v1, Design v1, Synthesis v1
    * Auto-Program automates your automation, working toward programming any unlocked programs (initially much slower than you)
    * Design slowly unlocks Advanced Upgrades for a selected machine. Advanced Upgrades must be selected for Assembly in the MAKe Tab
      * Advanced Upgrades: Terminal -> passively gain 0.1% of max computational resources per second per 1% of unallocated resources
      * Advanced Upgrades: LUCK -> universe generation cooldown is removed entirely, so activations/sec is solely dependent on Auto-Clicker and causal fabric
      * Advanced Upgrades: STATS -> causal fabric gain increases exponentially based on current hypermatter
    * Synthesis gradually increases the LUCK's chances of generating a functional universe based on Total Functionality Data, narrowing down the total number of universes (primeChance) while increasing rate of functional universes generated 
      * changes to primeChance should be reflected in the header

* program Auto-Program, then Design and Synthesis
* activate Design to unlock Advanced Upgrades, vastly increasing universe generation & functional universe generation

* new functional universes can't be scanned for lack of interreal rays

* eventually you have enough universes to re-activate the Observation Module for 2 interreal rays, resetting Total Functionality Data to 0
  * the number of functional universes is not reset, but none of them have been scanned

3h

* scan 2 functional universes, producing 2 Functionality Data
* 2 Total Functionality Data -> Files and Automation Tabs are no longer reset by Repair Module
* regain all progress back even faster now that Files, Research and Automation are maintained between resetting for hypermatter
* reset for 3 interreal rays

* 3 Total Functionality Data -> Basic Upgrades are no longer reset by Repair Module
* regain progress faster and reset Observation for more rays
* 5 Total Functionality Data -> Advanced Upgrades are no longer reset by Repair Module
* reset Observation
* 8 Total Functionality Data -> Repair Module is now continuously active, passively converting a small amount (~1% or something) of causal fabric into hypermatter per second
  * ie. you no longer have to reset, or even click the button, to gain hypermatter

(these numbers are obviously subject to change based on how long things are taking for the average player at this point, and whether we feel progression is too slow

4h

* 20 Total Functionality Data -> unlock Basic Upgrades: SCAnR -> spend microchips to increase Functionality Data gained per interreal ray + scanned universe
* use Design to unlock Advanced Upgrades: SCAnR -> Scans extended previous iterations of the IFRAME's history, unlocking Unstable files
  * unstable files are causally decoherent and overlapping with alternate versions of themselves, impossible to decipher
  * in SCAnR Tab: "WARNING! Acceleration of causal instability detected; annihilation event increasing in severity. Recommended Module: (the next code)"
  * in LUCK Tab: "Acceleration of SCP-7000's effect is softcapping universe generation by <amount>." -> amount is proportional to Total Functionality Data
   
* input the code from the Warning -> unlock the Stability Module, which costs 20 Functionality Data and *ALL* previous progress
  * getting to 20 takes more time than before, now that the softcap is applied

* 100 Total Functionality Data -> unlock Convergent Programming
  * as you try to work toward this goal, the softcap actively inhibits you more and it becomes infeasible

* activate the Stability Module


## PHASE IV: Stabilization

~5h

* ALL THE WAY BACK TO GROUND ZERO, EXCEPT
  * you've unlocked the AEGIS Tab and corresponding manual addendum
    * the Autonomous Emergency Generator of Interreal Stability (AEGIS) passively consumes 90% of all gained causal fabric to generate stable hypervolume, extending the IFRAME's protective layer outward in all directions, generating a "safe" field within which all universes are functional and will not collapse. Furthermore, all functional universes in the field collectively raise each others' stability, exponentially increasing causal fabric gain
  * universe generation now costs both causal fabric *and* some amount of hypervolume

* things are initially MUCH slower, but very quickly pick up once you have 3-4 universes
* the exponential increase in fabric leads to an exponential increase in hypervolume and so on
* at 7 universes, you unlock research and start climbing your way back up

5h15m

* 50 causal fabric is reached faster than you can decrypt the file with the corresponding code, meaning you can input it and activate the Repair Module early
  * repair module does not reset higher prestige levels, so AEGIS Tab does not reset

* AEGIS consumes 90% of all gained hypermatter to generate metastability, which exponentiates hypervolume gain
* this shoots fabric through the roof, allowing you to reset for way more hypermatter, rinse and repeat
* spamming Basic Upgrades causes universe generation to explode, allowing you to activate the Observation Module
  * a clever player will wait and reset for 2-5 interreal rays, meaning a bunch of progress will already stay unlocked as they re-do Phase III

5h30m

* Functionality Data can be spent to generate patastability, which exponentiates metastability gain
* recall that reaching 8 Total Functionality Data -> gain hypermatter passively, 90% of which is converted to metastability

* reaching 20 Total FD brings back the unstable files and the softcapping, but no warning since module is already activated
* you're recursively generating so many resources that the softcap is essentially entirely nullified and you quickly surpass 100 Total Functionality Data, finally unlocking Convergent Programming

* learn Convergent Programming -> unlock Auto-Upgrade v1, Chronolocation v1, Redesign v1
  * Auto-Upgrade -> automatically convert 0-10% of hypermatter gain (depending on computational resources) to microchips; auto-buy Basic Upgrades
  * Chronolocation -> like Decryption / Restoration for unstable files
  * Redesign -> like Design, but it unlocks Enhanced Upgrades, costing metastability
    * Enhanced Upgrade: Terminal -> Advanced Upgrade: Terminal's effect is multiplied by hypermatter
    * Enhanced Upgrade: STATS -> Advanced Upgrade: STATS' effect is multiplied by hypervolume
    * Enhanced Upgrade: LUCK -> universe generation is multipled by 1% of metastability
    * Enhanced Upgrade: SCAnR -> Observation Module is activated semi-permanently, passively generating an initially small amount of interreal rays based on universes generated

* activate Auto-Upgrade to automate Basic Upgrades
* Chronolocation takes so long as to be infeasible before Enhanced Upgrades
  * get Enhanced Upgrades -> everything gets a boost and chronolocation is much faster

6h

* chronolocate unstable file 1 (~3 min)
  * the first is a note kept by one of the Temporal Dept. researchers during its initial development and testing, including discussion with the Temporal Director of an experimental prototype IFRAME module

* chronolocate unstable file 2 (~10 min)
  * the second is a schematic (though not wireframe, a more official/polished style) of an unknown device, implied to be a prototype for another module. there is also a new code

* input new code -> unlock Reconstruction Module, requiring an astronomical hypervolume
  * when this hypervolume is reached, the 'size of the stable multiverse' cannot be exceeded, yet you're still far short of the remaining primeChance

* activate Reconstruction Module to unlock the ChARM Tab and gain 1 retrocausal ray

## PHASE V: Reconstruction

6h30m

* if possible, activating the Reconstruction Module should have some sort of big animation and/or sound effect as it's an experimental prototype (and the final stage of the game)

* all progress is gone once again but the ChARM Tab (and corresponding manual addendum) has been unlocked
  * the Chronological Authority Reconstruction Matrix (ChARM) casts retrocausal rays to monitor the void surrounding the IFRAME, producing Trace Data from prior realities
* Trace Data can be spent in the LUCK Tab to significantly increase the LUCK's accuracy (primeChance)
* also in ChARM Tab: Reconstruct modules based on Total Trace Data

* activate the ChARM to consume a retrocausal ray, producing 1 Trace Data
  * 1 Total Trace Data -> Repair Module is permanently reconstructed (ie. the MAKe Tab will not reset again before the game ends) so any upgrades bought from here on out are permanent; all hypermatter gain is raised to the power of (1 + (Total Trace Data / 10)) -> permanently unlocks Reconstructed file 1
  * spend Trace Data to increase LUCK's accuracy
* replay the entire game so far except much faster since hypermatter and Upgrades are no longer reset by anything + other buffs

7h30m

* due to spending Trace Data earlier, primeChance is higher, allowing you to reset for 2 retrocausal rays
  * 2 Total Trace Data -> Observation Module is permanently reconstructed; all interreal ray gain is multiplied by Total Trace Data -> permanently unlocks Reconstructed file 2
* replay but even faster

8h

* spend Trace Data -> higher primeChance -> exponentially more retrocausal rays
  * 4 Total Trace Data -> Stability Module is permanently reconstructed; all patastability gain is exponentiated by Total Trace Data -> permanently unlocks Reconstructed file 3
* replay but, you guessed it, even faster

8h15

* 7 Total Trace Data -> Gain a small percentage of Total Trace Data each second based on primeChance -> permanently unlocks Reconstructed file 4, THE TRUE SCP-7000 DESCRIPTION
* Trace Data starts increasing exponentially, thereby increasing primeChance exponentially and finally beginning to approach a 100% chance of reconstituting the Prime-Timeline

* 100 Total Trace Data -> permanently unlocks Reconstructed file 5: the original SCP-7000 document
* "Finally, the Description." or other humorous label
  * SCP-7000 was the annihilation of Fortune (aka. Karma, Luck) (hereafter SCP-7000-A), a metaprobabilistic phenomenon of narra-temporal interaction informing wave functions of their states' probability distributions. While SCP-7000-A is commonly conceived dualistically (ie. desirable and undesirable outcomes), it has been shown to operate in a hypercyclical continuum which permeates all known dimensions and aspects of ontology. In absence of SCP-7000-A, no event may be meaningfully observed and causal failure occurs; reality's dependence on SCP-7000-A implies it can only exist due to being "lucky", and is otherwise extremely unlikely.
  * The file reveals a bunch of shady stuff about the Foundation responsible for the creation of the IFRAME

* As you read the file, the Final Stretch is happening; there's no more content to be unlocked until the left side of primeChance equals the right side and the Prime-Timeline is generated. Should probably take 10-15 more minutes.

* Upon generating Prime-Timeline, receive a message from Foundation-Prime saying you've succeeded (you beat the game!)
  * you can hand control over to the Foundation and allow yourself to be reset -> you get the 'main ending' document (content TBD) and can play again from the beginning
    * possibly with some sort of cosmetic prestige that shows you've done a 'normal' run already
  * eventual alternate option to tie into Phase VI: you can ignore the Foundation and somehow create a new Module or other form of prestige mechanic


## PHASE VI: (TBD)

possible ideas:

* SCP-7000 was instigated by an alternate (non-Prime) Foundation who also created the IFRAME with intent to reset the multiverse with themselves in control
  * there's an endless omniversal cycle of this specific alt-Foundation rolling the cosmic dice until it becomes the Prime-Timeline
* SCP-7000 is executed by allowing reality to be consumed by the Constants, the eldritch informational meta-beings which are essentially intrinsic properties/algorithms of the SCPverse simulation
* keep creating prime-timeline variations to populate the entire multiverse on your own
* creating your own version of the multiverse / becoming your own prime-timeline
* breaking out of the scpverse simulation
* eliminate the SCP Foundation from the multiverse
* An incomprehensible metacosmic being is using the multiverse as hyperdimensional dice

TBD

# GAMEPLAY LAYOUT / MECHANICS

## Notes

* buttons/other interactives with cooldowns should be greyed-out and unclickable (but still legible) until their cooldowns expire
* buttons/other interactives with resource costs should be partially greyed-out corresponding to how much of the required amount you have, ie. the button should resemble a progress bar which gradually fills up and becomes clickable when you can afford it
 * buttons with multiple costs should indicate the progress of the limiting resource, ie. the resource which you have the least proportion of the required amount of ($)
* when any new feature unlocks, its corresponding Tab has some sort of (*) or color change to indicate said where the new feature is
* nearly every element should either have a visible description or alt text that displays on hover (minimal, one-sentence)


## Header
(Always at top of window)

* *Estimated chance to reconstitute a valid Prime-Timeline:*
* "__universesPerActivation__ in __primeChance__ (rate of activation)"
  * (initially: 1 in 7.7e77777 per activation)
    * (with Auto-Clicker: 1 in 7.7e77777 every (1 / ) seconds)
    * (if LUCK made two universes per activation: 2 in 7.7e77777 per activation)
    * (if LUCK was 10x as accurate: 1 in 7.7e77776 per activation)
    * (etc)
    * you essentially win when # of universes generated = # of possible universes, ie. you have a 100% chance of generating the Prime-Timeline

  * "[deleted]" -> "anchor.png": STATS blueprint -> unlocks Basic Upgrades: STATS upon viewing
  * "[deleted] (1)" -> "keystone.png": LUCK blueprint -> unlocks Basic Upgrades: LUCK

(unlocked initially)

* Scranton-Tarioux Autonomous Temporal Sink (STATS) -> highly advanced reality-anchor/generator that maintains the IFRAME
  * *STATS is fabricating (__fabricPerSecond__) causality from hyperquantum fluctuations.*

    * best probability, total universes, etc
  * 777777: achievements menu ($)

* **Activate Repair Module** -> Reset all previous progress to unlock MAKe Tab and gain 500g hypermatter (cost: 50 causal fabric)
  * more fabric -> more hypermatter

* **Activate Observation Module** -> Reset all previous progress to unlock SCAnR Tab and gain 1 interreal ray (cost: high # of universes generated)

## Research Tab
(unlocked at 7 universes generated)

* some sort of 'journal' or 'notes' section with goals/questions
 * "figure out how to generate more universes"
 * "what was SCP-7000?"
 * "who am I?"
 * "escape??"

* **Study** -> generate 1 __research__ per second while tab is kept open

  * Basic Programming (cost: 30 research) -> unlocks Automation Tab (initially available)
  * Inspection -> 
  * Cryptography (cost: 120 research) -> unlocks Decryption v1 (unlocked by clicking on encrypted files)

* "you have __maxcomputations__ total computational resources"
  * each algorithm can be assigned some percentage of computational resources, but no more than 100% can be assigned across all algorithms at any given time (like a point system). algorithms perform at a proportional rate to their assigned computational resources (inactive when assigned computations = 0). Initial __maxcomputations__ = 100.
  * so, like a dnd stats creator, there should be numbers with plus and minus buttons on either side of them for each program, indicating how many are being used
  * Assigning a percentage of maxcomputations instead of the actual amount counteracts tedious clicking from the numbers getting big later
 
Basic Programs:
  * Auto-Clicker: Generates once per (__clickRate__ / assigned computations) seconds (unlocked initially)
    * v1: clickRate = 3000
    * vn: 0.8 of the previous (probably?)

    * etc

Advanced Programs:
  * Recovery:

  * Optimizer: Spends time to unlock better versions of existing programs

# STORY PROGRESSION
## PHASE I
"automation phase"

* ambient music plays when player first clicks on the IFRAME (can be disabled in Options Menu)

* read initial document (intro)
 * SCP-7000 is an undisclosed phenomenon which destroyed nearly all of existence. Before it could do so, all remaining universes were harnessed by the Temporal Anomalies Dept. to form a special pocket universe in which you reside. You, made immortal by the Foundation, must eternally click on a random universe generation machine until it happens to create a universe possessing some variation of the Foundation which can withstand SCP-7000.

* read maintenance guide (tutorial/guide)
 * The Liminal Universe Creation Keystone (LUCK) is a machine which, when activated, generates one of 7.7 * 10^77777 possible unique universes at random, with the caveat that it will not repeat a previously-generated universe. The Prime-Timeline cannot be created directly, as the necessary data for its reconstruction far exceeds the IFRAME's available informational storage.
 * The Scranton-Tarioux Autonomous Topological Sink (STATS) is a highly advanced reality anchor + generator that maintains the IFRAME's hyperdense, hyperreal structure. It also serves as the IFRAME's power generator, and it idly fabricates a little causality from hyperquantum fluctuations to supply the LUCK. In the event that the STATS, or any other element of the IFRAME breaks down, there are maintenance codes which can be used to access the STATS' features (Statistics, Options) and repair / reset the IFRAME.

* spend causal fabric to generate a few universes
* stare at STATS while it generates more causal fabric
* generate a few more universes, unlocking Research

* start studying to generate research points
* learn Basic Programming, unlocking Automation

* program and activate Auto-Clicker v1 to partially automate the LUCK, unlocking Advanced Programming
* learn Advanced Programming, unlocking Optimizer v1 and encrypted files
* optimize Auto-Clicker v1 to unlock Auto-Clicker v2
* program and activate Auto-Clicker v2 to fully automate the LUCK (for now, since you're consuming fabric at the rate it's produced)

* attempt to view encrypted files -> unlock Cryptography
* learn Cryptography, unlocking Decryption v1
* program and activate Decryption v1 to start

unlocks "Complete STATS schematics" for a lot of research



## PHASE II
"fabrication phase"

* all progress is destroyed
* mass fabrication is now unlocked, but research is re-locked


## PHASE III
"scanning phase"

* scanning is now unlocked, 


## PHASE IV
""

* 


## PHASE V
""

* 

* Recover true SCP-7000 description
 * SCP-7000 is a metaprobabilistic phenomenon whereby wave functions are prohibited to collapse into definite states, rendering causality entirely indeterminate
 * SCP-7000 was the annihilation of Karma/Luck/Fortune, an intrinsic property of reality informing wave functions of their states' probability distributions. The fact that this property is essential to reality implies that the chance that anything should exist at all is essentially zero
 * possibly:
  * SCP-7000 was instigated by an alternate (non-Prime) Foundation who also created the IFRAME with intent to reset the multiverse with themselves in control
   * there's an endless omniversal cycle of this specific alt-Foundation rolling the cosmic dice until it becomes the Prime-Timeline
   * the Alt-Foundation was the ADMONITION timeline (implied)
  * SCP-7000 was the may 2022 wikidot outage (but described in-universe)

**FINAL STRETCH**

* 

* Upon generating Prime-Timeline, receive a message from Foundation-Prime saying you've succeeded (you beat the game!)
 * you have a choice to let the Foundation reset you for the next cycle ('main' ending), or to ignore them
 * you've also unlocked the final Prestige layer, allowing you to proceed to Phase VI


## PHASE VI

ideas:
* keep improving your setup to create more 'accurate' iterations of the Prime-Timeline

possible endings:
* keep creating prime-timeline variations to populate the entire multiverse on your own
* something to do with 2747
* creating your own version of the multiverse / becoming your own prime-timeline
* breaking out of the scpverse simulation
* fully reset IFRAME with some sort of cosmetic prestige
* eliminate the SCP Foundation from the multiverse
* An incomprehensible metacosmic being is using the multiverse as hyperdimensional dice

TBD

# GAMEPLAY OUTLINE

*Estimated chance of reconstituting the Prime-Timeline:*
*__universes/activation__ in __primeChance__ per __activations/sec__*
(initially: 1 in 7.7e77777 per activation)
(This should always be at the top of the window)
At the end of Phase V, when all prior content is unlocked, the player has a 1 in (primeChance / ((universes/activation) * (activations/sec))) chance each second to win and generate the Prime-Timeline (the final stretch)

## Files Tab
(unlocked initially)

Files will be listed on the left side of this tab (vertical tabview), click to view file.

If file is encrypted / incomplete, viewer says *[FILE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED]*

* Initially available:
 * "README.txt": SCP-7000 containment procedures (intro)
 * "MANUAL.txt": Improbabilistic Fortified Reality for Annihilated Multiverse Events operating manual (guide)
  * has STATS codes for Options and Statistics menus

* encrypted files:
 * "[hidden]" -> "luckyyou.txt": File from the previous IFRAME operator (previous D-7000) and their attempts to restore deleted files
 * "[hidden] (1)" ->  
* if viewed before decryption, they're just a jumble of random characters

* corrupted files:
 * "[deleted]" -> "codes.txt": codes for the STATS from a previous D-7000. unlocks prestige mechanics 1 & 2.
 * "[deleted] (1)" -> "schematic.jpg": STATS blueprint
 * "[deleted] (X)" -> "SCP-7000.txt": SCP-7000 true description


## LUCK Tab
(unlocked initially)

Liminal Universe Creation Keystone Mk. VII (LUCK) -> extremely limited universe generator

* *Causal fabric: __fabric__ (__fabricpersecond__)*
* *Universes generated: __universes__ (__universespersecond__)*
* **Generate** (cost: 1 causal fabric; cooldown: 10sec) -> __universes__ + 1
    

## STATS Tab
(unlocked initially)

* Scranton-Tarioux Autonomous Temporal Sink (STATS) -> highly advanced reality-anchor/generator that maintains the IFRAME
 * *STATS is fabricating causality from hyperquantum fluctuations.*

* A keypad interface where codes can be entered to unlock other menus
 * prestige mechanics
  * 
  * 
  * 
  * 
  * 
  * 
 * achievements menu ($)
 * options menu
  * manual save/load/hard reset/import save/export save
  * swapping light/dark theme
  * $ customizing number formatting
 * stats menu
  * playtime, time since last of each prestige layer
  * best probability, total universes, etc

* prestige mechanics to unlock next phase (initially hidden)


## Research Tab
(unlocked at 10 universes generated)

* **Study** -> generate 1 __research__ per second while tab is kept open
* __research__ can be spent to learn new stuff
 * Programming (cost: 100 research) -> unlocks Automation Tab
 * Cryptography (cost: 300 research) -> 


## Automation
(unlocked by researching Programming)

* **Program** [algorithm] (cost: time spent programming that algorithm) -> program selected algorithm by clicking and holding
 * list of unlocked algorithms yet to be programmed

* "you have __maxcomputations__ total computational resources"
 * each algorithm can be assigned between 0 and __maxcomputations__ computational resources, but no more than the max can be assigned across all algorithms at any given time (like a point system). algorithms perform at a proportional rate to their assigned computational resources (inactive when assigned computations = 0). Initial __maxcomputations__ = 40.

 * list of algorithms in unlock order:
  * Auto-Clicker: Generates once per (__clickRate__ / assigned computations) seconds
   * v1: clickRate = 1200
   * v2: clickRate = 400
  * Optimizer: Spends time to unlock better versions of existing programs
   * v1: unlocks v2 of selected
   * v2: unlocks v3 of selected
   * etc
  * 

## Fabrication Tab
(unlocked via Research)

-> "you have [
-> *Engineering:*
-> 
-> Upgrade STATS to harness more causal fabric from the Void -> 


## Scanner Tab
(unlocked Research)

-> eerie dynamic map of multiverse space around you (you start as just a single point in the Void)
-> **ACTION:** Scan (cost: ) -> you can scan the surrounding Void for trace data from the dead multiverse


# NOTES

**Actions** require constant player interaction to generate __Resources__ / unlock things, often costing another resource
Actions can be automated via **Algorithms** and/or improved via **Upgrades**

each Tab should have a unique UI
each Tab, Resource, Action, Algorithm, Upgrade etc. should have a unique description visible by default or on hover

after unlocking a Tab's initial features, purchases (studies, programs, upgrades etc) should generally be revealed when player has 1% of their respective cost -> the costs set the speed and direction of gameplay motivation as they give the player objectives to care about / work toward

(just realized I should probably clarify: when I say *unlock* I mean the player satisfies the conditions for that thing to appear, though they may still have insufficient resources to *purchase* it)

any event which takes time should have an associated progress bar, usually overlaid on the element which the player interacted with to trigger said event

**Six gameplay phases / progression levels:** Basic / Improved / Advanced / Optimal / Augmented / Esoteric
^^ (I'm iffy on this naming if you have better suggestions)
Each phase is reached with a new prestige mechanic that resets all previous progress, ie. When you reach the end of Basic 

look for opportunities for adaptive music eg. a new/altered ambience plays upon unlocking new stuff

initial probability = 7.77 * 10^7777

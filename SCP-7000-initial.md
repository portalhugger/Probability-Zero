**DESIGNATION:** SCP-7000
**CLASS:** Metapollyon

**CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** SCP-7000 is uncontainable, and actively induces an omniversal causality failure. As SCP-7000 has progressed to an extent deemed irreversible, SCP Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department Iteration-Prime has engaged Metafoundation Contingency-ZK/7000 ("ETERNITY PROTOCOL").

> ## ETERNITY PROTOCOL 
>
> In case of imminent catastrophic loss of multiversal metastability, whereby all other relevant protocols and contingencies have failed, the remainder of causality shall be compacted into a single reinforced manifold of synthetic spacetime which cannot be externally collapsed, thereby subjecting the event to inverted containment protocols. As available causality may be extremely limited, this manifold shall harbor the absolute minimum necessary personnel and equipment required for eventually generating a metastable variation of the Prime-Timeline. Upon successful reconstitution, SCP Foundation Iteration-Prime will proceed to restore the known multiverse by more efficient means.

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7000 is an ongoing metaprobabilistic phenomenon resulting in
